# Around: A Cloud and React based Social Network

* I Implemented features for users to create and browse posts and support search nearby posts. 
* I Improved the authentication using token based registration/login/logout flow with React Router v4.
* The web service in Go is launched to handle posts and deployed to Google Cloud (Google App Engine).
* ElasticSearch is used to provide search functions such that users can search recent posts and list personal posts

#### I have deployed the front-end to AWS Amplify and the back-end to GAE. The demo is accessible through this link <a href="https://prod.d8ue977pfd7if.amplifyapp.com" target="_blank">Around Interface</a>.
